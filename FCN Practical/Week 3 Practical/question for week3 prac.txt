- For the connection between router1 and switch, why we use fibre optic in this case 
   instead of using the straight-through cable? / 
- in what situation we need to use fiber optic to connect router and switch

- For this practical, why we using straight-through cable to connect wireless router to pc?
In what situation we can use straight-through cable to connect wireless router to pc
since router to pc is in same category

Miss why the connection between router and pc is using straight-through cable?
Not using cross-over cable since both are in same category?

Are we encouraged to use old version device like switch 2950 in assignment?
